The Corner Grocer Program Project: For this project has help me to create a program that reads item data from a file and provides functionalities to interact with this data through a user-friendly menu. The key problem it solved was allowing users to efficiently manage and analyze grocery item frequencies, providing options to search for a specific item, view all item frequencies, and display a histogram of item counts.
What I Did Particularly Well
Data Management: Efficiently loading data from a file into an unordered map ensured quick access and manipulation. Interface: Implemented a clear and intuitive menu-driven interface that made it easy for users to interact with the program.
Code Structure: Organized the code into a well-defined class with specific methods for each functionality, promoting modularity and reusability.
Most Challenging Pieces
File Handling and Data Loading: Ensuring that data is correctly read from the file and stored in an unordered map was challenging. Overcoming It: Thoroughly tested with different file formats and contents, and used ifstream for efficient file handling. Implementing a seamless and intuitive user menu required careful planning. Overcoming It: Iteratively refined the menu options and used a switch statement for clear navigation logic. Tools and Resources
IDE: Using a robust IDE like Visual Studio Code or CLion for coding and debugging.Documentation: Relying on official documentation for C++ libraries and functions.Community Support: Engaging with online programming communities like Stack Overflow for troubleshooting and advice.
Transferable Skills Data Structures: Knowledge of using data structures like unordered maps for efficient data storage and retrieval.File Handling: Skills in reading from and writing to files, essential for many applications. User Interface Design: Experience in designing and implementing user-friendly interfaces, valuable for both console and GUI applications.
Problem-Solving: Improved ability to break down complex problems and implement systematic solutions. Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability. Provided clear comments explaining the purpose of each function and important code segments.Modular Design: Organized code into functions and classes, making it easy to understand and modify.
Consistent Formatting: Used consistent indentation, spacing, and naming conventions for variables and functions.Error Handling: Implemented basic error handling to manage unexpected inputs or file issues, making the code more robust.
